According to the map, we should come across the marked route of the ship with the treasure in a few days. The ship supposedly belongs to a pirate called Silver. But I think it's more likely that this ship sank somewhere along this route some time ago, given how old and disintegrated the map is. As soon as we find the Wrak we will have to check if we need more tenders.

Whilst roaming the royal waters, I noticed that we can normally enter the harbours without being attacked. The garrisons of the harbours don't seem to have been informed about us. I don't think they've even told everyone in their ranks about this treasure. We must be careful, I believe more and more that this treasure will be the find of our lives. Another of the king's ships has caught us and this time it is much bigger than the last. It is a frigate. We can't escape it. We can only face it in battle, in attack!
