He doesn’t need much to live—just rum, gold, and the sea. When we anchored the ship at a trading port to replenish our supplies, some of my men approached me and spoke of a plantation they wanted to raid. They said there was plenty to loot and that the risk was manageable. It’s not uncommon for some of my men to come to me with such a request. Basically, I don't want to stand in the way of my men's wishes, but if things go wrong, it would result in unnecessary losses. However, since we won't set sail again until tomorrow morning anyway, we wouldn't lose any time if they plunder the plantation.","\n","ev","str","^Send Raiders","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-0","flg":20},"ev","str","^Continue travelling","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-1","flg":20},{"c-0":[{"->":"Raub"},"\n",{"#f":5}],"c-1":[{"->":"Weiterziehen"},"\n",{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"Raub":["^I agreed to the plan and pointed out that it would be advantageous for them to strike under the cover of night and try to avoid the guards. While the raiding party set off, I took care of the purchases in town. There were also some repairs to be done after the recent battles. When I was about to retire for the evening, one of my gunners woke me. Shocked, he told me that the raiding group had returned, but not all of them survived, and they hadn’t made off with any loot. Apparently, the whole group had been caught by a patrol, and during the fight, two of our men didn’t make it. What a disaster!
