Not much was left of Fleming's beautiful warship after our victory. It is off to join the other wrecks of the seas. That should give the navy a good blow. But they shouldn't be our biggest concern for now. My navigator reports an unusual sighting, a ship with old grey sails, as big as Fleming's warship. It flies no flag and is travelling according to the course on the treasure map. I get the feeling that Silver's ship is not a wreck on the bottom of the sea after all, but a ghost ship, doomed to sail this course forever. Forever, or until we have freed it from its prey.

So this is it at last. The end of our long journey is finally in sight and I'm already imagining all the things I'm going to buy with all that gold. Many of my men can hardly contain their excitement either. The last battle. The last hurdle to a life of freedom and prosperity. We're all going to set sail, far away from the navy and other pirates. On a peaceful and joyful island. A dream worth fighting for, a dream that will become reality after this battle. For freedom, for prosperity, for victory! Attack!
