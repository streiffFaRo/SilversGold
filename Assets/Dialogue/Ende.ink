It was a battle like no other. We were probably the first pirates to have to take on ghosts. Having killed the undead is probably the ultimate proof of our strength. We couldn't save all of the treasure, but I don't think I'll get any of my men to dive for the rest of the gold. No-one who witnessed this battle will ever dare to use this wrek again in their life. We're happy with what we've got, so much gold to help everyone live happily ever after. This is the end of the journey. This is the end of this logbook. <color="blue">This is the story of Silver's gold</color>.
