I've never seen anything like it. I ordered the ship to stop and take a longboat to him. He was very defensive at first, which was probably due to the fact that it's not exactly difficult to realise that we are pirates. But when I was able to make it clear to him that we didn't want to harm him and were just amazed at what a catch he had made, he told us about his adventures. He says that he has also caught sharks and then sells the meat in the harbours. As he talks like this, I wonder if it wouldn't be a good idea to recruit him for our cause. Of course, I would also have to offer him a decent wage.","\n","ev","str","^Recruit (30 Booty)","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-0","flg":20},"ev","str","^Continue travelling","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-1","flg":20},{"c-0":[{"->":"Rekrutieren"},"\n",{"#f":5}],"c-1":[{"->":"Weiterziehen"},"\n",{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"Rekrutieren":["^I waited patiently until he had finished his story and then politely offered him the chance to become part of our crew. He replied hesitantly, but when I offered him certain payment, he agreed. I'm not sure but I think it was more the camaraderie than the gold that convinced him to join us. In any case, I'm very happy to have him with us. In bad times, we can rely on his stories to give us new courage.
