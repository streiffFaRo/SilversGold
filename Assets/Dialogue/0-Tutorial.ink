The open ocean as far as the eye can see. It hides so many secrets and treasures. <color="blue">It's time to make some serious booty again</color>. The crew have been asking for it for months. Nobody dares to say it openly, but I can feel it. We'll probably have to dock at a harbour again soon. A night in the tavern will temporarily boost morale.
I was able to make good use of the night in the harbour, while my men enjoyed themselves I spoke to some sailors and traders who said that <color="blue">a well-loaded merchant ship will soon be sailing this route</color>. I hope we’ll be able to intercept them.
The sea has heard our pleas. <color="blue">My scout reports the merchant ship</color> and the situation is even better than expected - no escorts in sight, this will be a piece of cake! With this booty, we’ll get by for another month and maybe even upgrade the ship—if all goes according to plan. Get ready to board!
