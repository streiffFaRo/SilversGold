The white flag indicates that they are coming in peace, most likely to negotiate. One of the soldiers introduces himself as a captain in the service of an Admiral Flemming. The admiral demands our immediate and absolute surrender and the handing over of the treasure map. In return, we are to receive a quick death. That doesn't seem like a very good offer to me. He doesn't seem to know who he's threatening. The captain seems to think we would accept this offer. How should I answer him? Maybe I should make him the same offer or I could send him back his soldiers without their uniform and their flag with a nice skull and crossbones on it.","\n","ev","str","^Make the same offer","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-0","flg":20},"ev","str","^Mock him","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-1","flg":20},{"c-0":[{"->":"Angebot"},"\n",{"#f":5}],"c-1":[{"->":"Verarschen"},"\n",{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"Angebot":["^I have decided to hold up a mirror to this admiral.
